    <h1>How do I see the differences between HTML and CSS?</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the difference between the usage of HTML and CSS?</li>
      <p>
        HTML is used for a content of a website, CSS is used for styling the
        content.
      </p>
      <li>What is the newest version of HTML?</li>
      <p>HTML5</p>
      <li>
        What are the top five most used HTML5 elements? If not sure, make a
        guess.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>head</li>
        <li>title</li>
        <li>body</li>
        <li>paragraph</li>
        <li>heading</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Have you checked out the HTML5 cheatsheet?</li>
      Yes, I did.
      <li>
        What is the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements?
      </li>
      <p>
        Semantic elements are elements with a meaning, these elements describe
        the content they are supposed to contain.
      </p>
      <li>Why do we prefer using semantic elements?</li>
      <p>
        Code is easier to read and understand. Screen readers and browsers can
        interpret Semantic HTML better, which makes it more accessible.
      </p>
      <li>Do all browsers support all of the newest HTML / CSS elements?</li>
      <p>
        They do not. You can find browser support and compatibility in the
        cheatsheet you mentioned above.
      </p>
